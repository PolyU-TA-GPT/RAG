To this purpose, seminars may\ninclude a variety of tasks including problem and essay questions. Problem questions in\nseminars align with the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) (a), (c) and (d) by enabling\nstudents to develop the ability to identify, explain and apply legal rules to resolve\nbusiness problems, issues and/or challenges. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and\nQuizzes which are in line with ILOs (a), (b), (c) and (d) d will enable students to\nacquired good knowledge, clear understanding and accurate application of the relevant\nlegal concepts and principles of law.\nEssay assignment questions reflect ILOs (a), (d), (e) and (g) as students develop the\nability to identify, explain and analyze critically key issues of HK company law, its\nreform and policy effects. Students will also be required to participate actively in\nseminars, in line with ILOs (c), (d) and (f), by raising relevant questions, making\ncomments or critiques, advancing explanations, or stating arguments.\nDiscussing and writing on an essay assignment study is aligned with ILOs (c), (d), (e),\n(f) and (g). This activity allows the students to learn how to write and develop concepts\nand arguments in a logical, analytical and critical manner, and how to use basic\nresearch tools including internet, library and other resources to this effect."
