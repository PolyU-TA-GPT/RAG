The growing volume of both structured\nand unstructured data has pushed forward a more data- driven form of decision\nmaking. Future accountants need to be able to collect and work with data. This\nsubject aims to first introduce various accounting and financial research datasets\nand to provide students various quantitative analysis techniques in developing\nanalytical data models to support decision-making. With the information developed\nfrom data modeling, it is crucial to communicate practical implications of\nquantitative analyses to any kind of audience member. This subject aims to further\nprovide an introduction as well as a hands-on experience in data visualization and\nvisual analytics to help summarize large amount of data effectively. Students will\nlearn to combine analytic and interactive visualization approaches and use them to\ndemonstrate or provide insights into real-world problems and situations."

In seminars, students\nwill gain a better understanding of key legal principles, and apply them to various issues\nand scenarios involving companies and their directors, shareholders and other\nstakeholders, and/or to think about those principles in a critical manner. By working and\nwriting an essay assignment, the students will elaborate, in a deeper and more extensive\nway, on a selected topic of HK company law.\nIn seminars, the students will be required to describe concepts and answer questions\neither by oral presentations or by writing exercises. To this purpose, seminars may\ninclude a variety of tasks including problem and essay questions. Problem questions in\nseminars align with the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) (a), (c) and (d) by enabling\nstudents to develop the ability to identify, explain and apply legal rules to resolve\nbusiness problems, issues and/or challenges. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and\nQuizzes which are in line with ILOs (a), (b), (c) and (d) d will enable students to\nacquired good knowledge, clear understanding and accurate application of the relevant\nlegal concepts and principles of law.\nEssay assignment questions reflect ILOs (a), (d), (e) and (g) as students develop the\nability to identify, explain and analyze critically key issues of HK company law, its\nreform and policy effects. Students will also be required to participate actively in\nseminars, in line with ILOs (c), (d) and (f), by raising relevant questions, making\ncomments or critiques, advancing explanations, or stating arguments.\nDiscussing and writing on an essay assignment study is aligned with ILOs (c), (d), (e),\n(f) and (g). This activity allows the students to learn how to write and develop concepts\nand arguments in a logical, analytical and critical manner, and how to use basic\nresearch tools including internet, library and other resources to this effect."

This\nsubject aims to first introduce various accounting and financial research datasets\nand to provide students various quantitative analysis techniques in developing\nanalytical data models to support decision-making. With the information developed\nfrom data modeling, it is crucial to communicate practical implications of\nquantitative analyses to any kind of audience member. This subject aims to further\nprovide an introduction as well as a hands-on experience in data visualization and\nvisual analytics to help summarize large amount of data effectively. Students will\nlearn to combine analytic and interactive visualization approaches and use them to\ndemonstrate or provide insights into real-world problems and situations."

Students are encouraged to discuss those questions, to\nthink actively and critically, and to talk about their opinions or solutions.\nProblem sets provide students with a chance to review the core knowledge lectured\nin the class, including numerical examples, open-ended questions, and some\napplications to real-world situations. A tutorial is conducted after each problem set is\nexercised by students. It provides with an opportunity to deepen students\u2019\nunderstanding and reinforce their skills. Problem sets and tutorials also serve as a\nchannel through which timely feedbacks will be collected from and given to students."

By working and\nwriting an essay assignment, the students will elaborate, in a deeper and more extensive\nway, on a selected topic of HK company law.\nIn seminars, the students will be required to describe concepts and answer questions\neither by oral presentations or by writing exercises. To this purpose, seminars may\ninclude a variety of tasks including problem and essay questions. Problem questions in\nseminars align with the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) (a), (c) and (d) by enabling\nstudents to develop the ability to identify, explain and apply legal rules to resolve\nbusiness problems, issues and/or challenges. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and\nQuizzes which are in line with ILOs (a), (b), (c) and (d) d will enable students to\nacquired good knowledge, clear understanding and accurate application of the relevant\nlegal concepts and principles of law.\nEssay assignment questions reflect ILOs (a), (d), (e) and (g) as students develop the\nability to identify, explain and analyze critically key issues of HK company law, its\nreform and policy effects. Students will also be required to participate actively in\nseminars, in line with ILOs (c), (d) and (f), by raising relevant questions, making\ncomments or critiques, advancing explanations, or stating arguments.\nDiscussing and writing on an essay assignment study is aligned with ILOs (c), (d), (e),\n(f) and (g). This activity allows the students to learn how to write and develop concepts\nand arguments in a logical, analytical and critical manner, and how to use basic\nresearch tools including internet, library and other resources to this effect."

This\nsubject aims to first introduce various accounting and financial research datasets\nand to provide students various quantitative analysis techniques in developing\nanalytical data models to support decision-making. With the information developed\nfrom data modeling, it is crucial to communicate practical implications of\nquantitative analyses to any kind of audience member. This subject aims to further\nprovide an introduction as well as a hands-on experience in data visualization and\nvisual analytics to help summarize large amount of data effectively. Students will\nlearn to combine analytic and interactive visualization approaches and use them to\ndemonstrate or provide insights into real-world problems and situations."

Students are encouraged to discuss those questions, to\nthink actively and critically, and to talk about their opinions or solutions.\nProblem sets provide students with a chance to review the core knowledge lectured\nin the class, including numerical examples, open-ended questions, and some\napplications to real-world situations. A tutorial is conducted after each problem set is\nexercised by students. It provides with an opportunity to deepen students\u2019\nunderstanding and reinforce their skills. Problem sets and tutorials also serve as a\nchannel through which timely feedbacks will be collected from and given to students."
