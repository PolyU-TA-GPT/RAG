Special Readmission Scheme for 2024/25  Due to the overwhelming number of hall applications received every year, local students with prior hall experience and non-local students in their 2nd year or above may have difficulty to be readmitted into the halls. The Special Readmission Scheme (SRS) is a discretionary arrangement with the aim to handle the re-admission of the aforementioned students who have made significant contribution to hall life, maintained good student conduct, and sustained satisfactory academic performance. This discretionary arrangement is not applicable to the CURI Residential College  which has its own readmission scheme.   A. Eligibility  All applicants should be full-time students studying in UGC-funded degree programmes; and     non-local residents who will take the second year of study or above in the following academic year; or    local residents who have continuously resided in hall for at least 2 months between Sep. and Apr. of the following year.   Note: students being barred from hall application and admission are not eligible to this scheme.  B. Hall Admission Committee (HAC)  The HAC is commissioned to maintain a consistent and transparent system for re-admitting students who have actively contributed to/participated in hall activities. The HAC reserves the right to make the final decision on all SRS applications and the right to revoke the SRS offer if deemed necessary and appropriate.  C. Consideration Factors and Scoring Mechanism  The HAC Committee grants discretionary hall places with reference to the following consideration factors and scoring mechanism:                 a)        Contribution to & Participation in Hall Activities        max 60 marks                  b)        Student conduct        max 20 marks                  c)        Academic performance (CGPA result)        max 20 marks                  d)         Hall Association members (Hung Hom Halls only)        max 10 marks                         Total               max 100 marks (Homantin Halls)        max 110 marks (Hung Hom Halls)                     Applicants can only apply for the hall in which they have once lived during the year of application.    If an applicant has changed to other halls during the year of application, the participation and contribution marks shall only include those activities’ end date fell in the residential period of the hall that s/he applies for.    If an applicant engages in one semester or above in Outbound Exchange or Overseas Work-Integrated Education (WIE) which requires him/her to be physically present in a foreign country in the year of SRS application, his/her Participation & Contribution (P&C) Records in his/her latest two semesters of hall residence in the current or last academic year, excluding summer semester, will be considered*. For example, if s/he joined an outbound exchange program in the first semester of 2023/24, when s/he applies for SRS in Apr. 2024, his/her P&C records of the second semester of 2022/23 and the second semester of 2023/24 will be considered. The prevailing rules governing hall transfer situations (Point C2) and the ceiling of each category (Point D1) should still be compiled with. Students should declare the abovementioned engagement and provide valid document proof in the online system by 30 Apr 2024 for verification of eligibility. *As CURI RC focuses on research-related activities and has a different readmission mechanism with SRS, students living in CURI RC in the previous year may not have comparable P&C marks in the context of SRS. In such situation, the P&C marks of the semester that the applicant staying in hall will be doubled as the P&C marks for the whole year.     Applicants with equal marks will be further prioritized by drawing lots.
